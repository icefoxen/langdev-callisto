(* modules.ml
   This has all the stuff that involves the parsing and loading of
   modules.

   Ideally, we should be able to load modules either from files or from
   whatever database interface we want...

   It'd be keen to only do databases, but people would bitch about
   portability and such.

   ...hm.  What we need is some unified thingamadugin input interface
   that can read and resolve things intellegently either from files or
   from a database.

   The lexer can pull from a string instead of a channel, so that rocks.
   Then we just need some unified way of referring to things...  which
   I suppose is the module system itself.  You just need to tell the
   compiler beforehand whether you want to pull from files, from
   a database, or maybe both.

   Hm, that can be done.  It just needs the right interface.

   The compiler needs to know where libraries are, though.  That
   can be part of the database module, but is it part of the 

   Hmm.  I think it would be reasonable to just use the symtbl data
   structure as a module structure.  It IS basically right, so.
   And any changes that need to be made to one should be made to the other
   anyway.

   And we suddenly get heirarchical modules for free.  Wiggy.  I just
   have to write the mechanics for them, but the data structure is in place.
   
   Hokay.  FOR NOW, just write the text-file interface.

   ...so.  The way it works is this:
   After semantically checking everything, it goes through the syntax
   tree and dumps all the decls to a string or file.
   
   To read 'em back, we parse the file and get a list of decls.  We can
   then go through and feed 'em into the symbol table without too much
   trouble, I think.

   Recall that order of operations is important:
   1) Populate symbol table
   2) Add exports, check they exist
   3) Import symbols
   4) Semantic jazz


   Hokay.  We need to make sure we do:
   Make module/library paths work

   XXX: Importing does not work, because the final assembly symbol is
   put in the local module!  So if we import testlib2 into test3, and
   call the function testlib2:foo as (foo), it compiles to test3_foo.
   To fix this, we will need to make ALL symbols in the symbol table
   have an absolute module path.  However, this is kinda tricksy, since
   it makes lookup more complicated; we will need a list of module paths
   to search to find "local" symbols.  Either that or an absolute way of
   figuring out where an arbitrary identifier came from, which seems more
   complicated.
   ...still.  using modules still works just fine, which is enough for our
   purposes right now.  This is harder than it looks, it seems.
