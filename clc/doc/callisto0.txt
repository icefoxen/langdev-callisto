*Introduction 
Callisto is a programming language designed for low-level processing and
system programming. It is essentially designed to replace C and be simpler
than baroque alternatives like C++ and D.
It has utterly no redeeming features from a language research standpoint,
I'm sure.  But for fuck's sake, C and its derivatives have to die, and I don't
yet believe that more advanced languages like C# and OCaml and junk can
fully replace it.  How many of these languages use runtimes written in C or
C++?  How much microcontroller code is there written in C#?


Notable features:
Strong static typing
Parametric polymorphism
Well-defined modules
Tagged unions
First-class functions
Enumerations
Bounds-checked arrays
Pointers allowing access to raw memory and such low-level stuff
Exceptions


More complex things we probably want to include later:
Functions taking variable number of arguments
Default argument values, optional args, and such.
Functions returning multiple values
Arbitrary-base integer literals
Expressions in array literals?
Different size integers.
Unicode
More reflection, dynamic compilation etc
Array slicing
Iterators, etc
Default values and initialization syntax for structures
Inline assembler
Tail call optimization
SOME kind of more flexible type extension method...  objects or something.


Iffy things we probably don't want to include later but are worth thinking 
about:
Type classes
Type inference
Type conversions
Storage analysis
Immutable variables



We leave out for now:
Objects.  We can write Obj-C-like object systems in this language pretty easily.
GC and such.  Too much infrastructure.
Multiprocessing.  Also too much infrastructure, and no clear right way to do it.
Symbols.   Sorry, use enums for now.


*Lexical Elements 
**Identifiers 
Identifiers are case-sensitive. They may not start with numbers, but may
include the characters a-z, A-Z, and 0-9, as well as +, -, *, /, !, >, <,
_, =, and probably a few other things.

**Comments 
Line comments start with a semicolon (;). Block comments start with /- and end with -/. Block comments may be nested.

**Literals 
Integer literals are strings of numbers 0-9. "0x" followed by a string of
0-9 and a-f or A-F (case insensitive) are hexadecimal integers. "0b"
followed by a string of 0-1 are binary integers. "0o" followed by a string
of 0-7 are octal numbers.  All can be preceeded by a minus sign.

Floating point literals are just numbers 0-9, a decimal point, and some more
numbers 0-9. You can also put an exponential term at the end, such as 3.5e3,
or 94.364E-4. Case on the "e" doesn't matter.  They can be preceeded by a
minus sign.

Array literals are a list of literals surrounded by {curly brackets}.
All elements in an array literal must have the same type.  You cannot
put expressions in array literals at this point.

A single character enclosed in single quotes (') is a character literal. There
are also several escape sequences for non-printable characters: '\t' is a tab,
'\n' is a newline, '\r' is a carriage return, and '\b' is a backspace. '\X'
where X is any integer literal (as above) specifies a character literal with
that ASCII value. You know the drill.

For now, characters are just 7-bit ASCII.  Unicode will come later.
Note that characters are CHARACTERS, not numbers.  Their size is not
guarenteed to be a byte, or anything else.

Strings are delimited by double quotes ("). A string is just an array of
characters. Character literals can be embedded in strings, just do the
backslash escape sequence.


**Reserved symbols

Reserved names and symbols are: 
if then elif else while do end fun in : , ( ) [ ] { } def defun " ' typecase
struct type enum union <- var

*Types and Type System
KISS.  Basic atomic types: integers, floats, characters.  Pointers and enums
and functions as well.  
Then we have compound types: tagged unions, arrays and structs
Atomic types cannot be decomposed into simpler elements, while compound types
can.

We do the Java-ish value vs. reference type.  All atomic types are value
types, all compound types are reference types
XXX: Actually, should tagged unions be reference types?  They could be 
references themselves, just sorta fat...  Hm.

We also want parametric polymorphism.  Polymorphic types are just given by a
name prefixed with a %.  You can do nothing with a polymorphic value except
assign it, return it, or call another polymorphic function on it.  For
instance:

defun foo v1 %a, v2 %a (bool)
   return (= v1 v2)
end

has type
fun( %a, %a )( bool )
Each %a must be the same.  If they were different types you'd have to give them different names, such as:

defun bar v1 %a, v2 %b (someType)
   return (doSomethingWith v1 v2)
end

This has type fun( %a, %b )( someType )


Types can contain other types...  arrays are the most obvious example, for instance
"array(int)" or even "array(%t)".

Right now, for the sake of oh-gods simplicity...
1) There is no way to convert types into each other, and
2) Integers and floats are seperate types entirely.  + is not the same 
function as ++
This will proooooobably change later.


**Type definitions
New types can be defined with the syntax:
type x: y
which creates a new type "x" which is eqivilant to type "y".
Polymorphism and such can be applied here.  So you can write
type intArray: array(int)
to create a version of the array type that only accepts integer values.
If you wanted to create a new type of array that could accept either
integer or float values, you'd have to use a tagged union.


**Numbers 
We've covered this pretty well.  Integers and floats.  Integers are at the 
moment whatever size machine word is handy, and are always signed.  Floating 
point numbers are IEEE.754 or whatever it is.  Keep it simple for now.  An
integer overflow is an error, and should be treated as such.

**Arrays
Arrays are a contiguous whack of memory.  They have a fixed length, they know
their length, and do automatic bounds-checking (there will be a compiler switch 
to tell them not to, probably).
They do parametric polymorphism too, as demonstrated above.

Arrays elements are indexed by the syntax
arr[i]
and are assigned to by the syntax
arr[i] <- val
where both arr and i can be expressions.

**Characters
Characters, we've gone over.  In this version, they are simply ASCII.

**Strings
Strings are arrays of characters.  Nothing special apart from syntax.
var x string: {'a', 'b', 'c'}
is eqilvilant to
var x array(char): "abc"
and so on.
Strings can be referenced and assigned just like arrays can.

**Structures
Structures are a bunch of different types mooshed together. 
This declares a new structure of type "foo" with three members: an integer x, a
float y, and a reference to another foo structure "z".
struct foo:
   x int
   y float
   z foo
end

Structures can be polymorphic:

struct list(%t):
   item %t
   next list(%t)
end

Structures, like arrays, are indexed in the familiar C-ish way.
list.item
list.next <- nextNode
; Delete a node
list.next <- list.next.next

**Pointers
Pointers are for low-level programming.  You can point them at arbitrary
addresses.  You can do arithmatic and let them dangle and overrun arrays and
fandango on core and all sorts of things.  Try to never use them unless you're
writing something like an operating system or memory manager.

def someFoo foo: ...
def p1 pointer: (ref someFoo)
def foo2 foo: (deref p1)
p1 <- (+ p1 -79)
foo2 <- (deref p1)  ; Kaboom!  You'd better pray this segfaults.


**Tagged Unions
Tagged unions consist of an integer and a reference smooshed against each other.
Yeah, I dunno how to explain these right now.  They could be done better.

union foo:
   Foo( int )
   Bar( somestruct )
   Bop( float )
end

var x foo: :Foo( 10 )
typecase x:
   case Foo: (doSomethingWithInt x)
   case Bar: (doSomethingWithSomeStruct x)
   case Bop: (doSomethingWithFloat x)
end

typecase x:
   case Bop: (doSomethingWithFloat x)
   else: ; You can insert arbitrary code here, but will get type errors if
         ; you treat x as anything besides polymorphic
end

You can't deconstruct a union to get at its member without using a 
typecase.  This preserves safety, even if it's a bit of a pain in the butt.
Or you could use a pointer, if you wanted to make Baby Jesus cry:

var x foo: :Bop( 10.0 )
var p pointer: (ref x)  ; p now points at the address of x
; Assuming that a 'foo' is 4 bytes of tag plus 4 bytes of float, this would
; result in the value '10.0'
p <- (+ p 4)
var f float: (deref p)



**Enumerations
Enumerations are basically named numbers.  However, unlike C, they're actually
type-checked.  If something has an enumeration type you can't shove an integer
into it, and vice versa.

enum foo:
   Foo  ; = 0
   Foo2 ; = 1
   Bar <- 30  ; = 30
   Bop  ; = 31
   Baz <- -3  ; = -3
   Quux <- 30  ; Compilation error; duplicates are invalid.
end

We may automagically get a couple functions now...  foo2int and int2foo.
This lets enumerations have meaningful numerical values, like months and
stuff.  For int2foo, they'll naturally check that the integer is actually in a 
valid range.  It'd be sweet if we could wrangle that.
The alternative is not having enumerations have numerical values at all...  
But that sorta sucks, for things like months etc.

XXX: But what if there are already functions called int2foo and foo2int?


*Program Structure

Everything is evaluated from left to right. All expressions are evaluated in
the order they are written (unless the compiler can prove it doesn't matter).
Program execution probably starts at the function called "main" which recieves
as its argument an array of strings as its argument, and returns an integer as
the program's return value, yadda yadda.

A program is a bunch of statements, for now. We may add more declerations like 
namespaces and such soon.

*Statements

There are only a few kinds of statements: global variable defintions (for
globals, constants, functions, etc), and type definitions (structures, etc).
We will add module definitions somewhere.

The most basic thing is global variable definitions, which are also used for function definitions with a bit of syntactic sugar

def somename type: someexpression

def somefunc function-of-whatever-type-signature: fun args (rettype) ... end

defun funcname args (rettype) end

**Type Definition
type foo: bar
struct foo: ... end
union foo: ... end
enum foo: ... end


**Builtin types:
int
float
char
string
array(%a)
pointer(%a)
fun(argtype, argtype, ...)(rettype)

There will (someday) be more builtin types of various sizes; long, double, 
byte, word, possibly a few more.  There will be types that explicitly state
their size and signedness, such as 'int8', 'uint8', 'int16', 'uint16', etc.
There will also be constants that tell you just how big 'int', 'float' and so
on are on the given platform.

We'll have basically the entire Scheme numerical tower as well, it'll just be
a library.


*Expressions

We start with only a few types of expressions apart from literals and
variables: function definitions, if statements, while statements, function
calls, and variable bindings, and typecases.

XXX: To do: Assignment!  Doh.
XXX: Hmm.  Array references CAN be functions, but that's sorta nasty.
Structure references are even worse.
XXX: Explicit scope blocks?


**Function Definitions

SOMEDAY, functions will return multiple values, and have the potential to take
arbitrary numbers of arguments.
Right now, these are anonymous functions.  Non-anonymous functions are
just global variables.

So far, functions must ALWAYS return at least one value.  This may end up
changing.  Zero is just another possible number of return values.

fun x int, y float, z somethingelse (returntype) ... end


**Function Calls

(f x1 x2 ...)

All math and logic and such is function calls for now.
It'd be nice to inline them someday.

**If and While

if a then b [elif c]* [else z] end

while a do b end

**Variable Binding

var x int: a
var y float: b
var z somethingelse: c
var a int, b float, c string: (someComplicatedFunction)

XXX: Explicit scope a la Lisp is cool!
Possibly not what we want to do in the end, but cool nonetheless.

**Typecase
typecase x:
   case Foo: (doSomethingWithInt x)
   case Bar: (doSomethingWithSomeStruct x)
   case Bop: (doSomethingWithFloat x)
end

**Return
return <expr>
return <expr> <expr> <expr>

**Assignment
a <- b
; Simultanious assignment
a b c <- d e f
; For instance, you could swap two values with
a b <- b a

*Modules

Right now, we have no module system.

The choices here abound.  Modules can be flat or heirarchical, covert or overt (hides or exposes things by default), simple or complex...

I somewhat like the C# system of namespaces, actually.  Heirarchical namespaces that are not explicitly connected to any single file or such, but magically mesh together during loading.


*Exceptions
Oy.


*Library
We need ratios and bignums.  Basically, the whole Scheme numerical tower.
Check out Cocoa.


*Low Level Junk

**Function Call Stuff 
The function caller pushes stuff on the stack, and is responsible for popping
it afterwards. The function called leaves the results on top of the stack
though, so the caller should probably move them somewhere safe before popping
everything.

**Name Mangling
