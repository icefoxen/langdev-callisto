*Introduction 
Callisto is a programming language designed for low-level processing and
system programming. It is essentially designed to replace C and be simpler
than baroque alternatives like C++ and D.
It has utterly no redeeming features from a language research standpoint,
I'm sure.  But for fuck's sake, C and its derivatives have to die, and I don't
yet believe that more advanced languages like C# and OCaml and junk can
fully replace it.  How many of these languages use runtimes written in C or
C++?
(Suitably parenthesized... Lisp guys, I know Lisp can be used to write its
own runtime with a bit of bootstrapping, but face it...  Lisp is terrible at
working with current computer systems, and if anybody had the balls to
write a modern system where Lisp didn't completely clash with everything,
they would have done it already.  Besides, Common Lisp is a huge ball of
committee-mud that's half-stuck in the 70's.  So.  Yeah.)

Screw simplicity, let's go for broke and make a complete spec.

Notable features:
Strong static typing
Parametric polymorphism
Well-defined modules
Tagged unions
First-class functions
Enumerations
Bounds-checked arrays
Pointers creating access to low-level implementation stuff
Exceptions


Iffy things we probably want to include later:
Functions taking multiple arguments
Default arguments and such.
Functions returning multiple values
Arbitrary-base integer literals
Expressions in array literals?
Different size integers.
Unicode
More reflection, dynamic compilation etc
Array slicing
Iterators, etc
Default values and initialization syntax for structures


Iffy things we probably don't want to include later:
Type classes
Type inference
Type conversions
Storage analysis
Immutable variables



We leave out for now:
Objects.  We can write Obj-C-like object systems in this language pretty easily.
GC and such.  Too much infrastructure.
Multiprocessing.  Also too much infrastructure, and no clear right way to do it.
Symbols.   Sorry, use enums.


*Lexical Elements 
**Identifiers 
Identifiers are case-sensitive. They may not start with numbers, but may
include the characters a-z, A-Z, and 0-9, as well as +, -, *, /, !, >, <,
_, =, and probably a few other things.

**Comments 
Line comments start with a semicolon (;). Block comments start with /- and end with -/. Block comments may be nested.

**Literals 
Integer literals are strings of numbers 0-9. "0x" followed by a string of
0-9 and a-f or A-F (case insensitive) are hexadecimal integers. "0b"
followed by a string of 0-1 are binary integers. "0o" followed by a string
of 0-7 are octal numbers.

Floating point literals are just numbers 0-9, a decimal point, and some more
numbers 0-9. You can also put an exponential term at the end, such as 3.5e3,
or 94.364E-4. Case on the "e" doesn't matter.

Array literals are a list of literals surrounded by {curly brackets}.
All elements in an array literal must have the same type.  You cannot
put expressions in array literals at this point.

A single character enclosed in single quotes (') is a character literal. There
are also several escape sequences for non-printable characters: '\t' is a tab,
'\n' is a newline, '\r' is a carriage return, and '\b' is a backspace. '\X'
where X is any integer literal (as above) specifies a character literal with
that ASCII value. You know the drill.

For now, characters are just 7-bit ASCII.  Unicode will come later.
Note that characters are CHARACTERS, not numbers.  Their size is not
guarenteed to be a byte, or anything else.

Strings are delimited by double quotes ("). A string is just an array of
characters. Character literals can be embedded in strings, just do the
backslash escape sequence.


**Reserved symbols

Reserved names and symbols are: 
if then elif else while do end fun in : , ( ) [ ] { } def defun " ' typecase
struct type enum union <-

*Types and Type System
KISS.  Basic atomic types: integers, floats, characters.  Pointers and enums
and functions as well.
Then we have compound types: functions, tagged unions, arrays and structs

We do the Java-ish value vs. reference type.  Strings, structures, tagged unions
and arrays are all reference types.
XXX: Actually, should tagged unions be reference types?  They could be references
themselves...  Hm.

We also want parametric polymorphism.  Polymorphic types are just given by a
name prefixed with a %.  You can do nothing with a polymorphic type except
assign it, return it, or call another polymorphic function on it.  For
instance:

defun foo v1 %t, v2 %t {bool}
   return (= v1 v2)
end


Types can contain other types...  arrays are the most obvious example, for instance
"array(int)" or even "array(%t)".

Right now, for the sake of oh-gods simplicity...
1) There is no way to convert types into each other, and
2) Integers and floats are seperate types entirely.  + is not the same 
function as +.
Gods help me.


**Type definitions
New types can be defined with the syntax:
type x: y
which creates a new type "x" which is eqivilant to type "y".
Polymorphism and such can be applied here.  So you can write
type intArray: array(int)
to create a version of the array type that only accepts integer values.
If you wanted to create a new type of array that could accept either
integer or float values, you'd have to use a tagged union.


**Numbers 
We've covered this pretty well.  Integers and floats.  Integers are at the moment
whatever size machine word is handy.  Floating points are IEEE.754 or whatever it
is.

**Arrays
Arrays are a contiguous whack of memory.  They have a fixed length, they know
their length, and do automatic bounds-checking unless you tell them not to.
They do parametric polymorphism too, as demonstrated above.

Arrays elements are indexed by the syntax
arr[i]
and are assigned to by the syntax
arr[i] <- val
where both arr and i can be expressions.

**Characters
Characters, we've gone over.

**Strings
Strings are arrays of characters.  Nothing special apart from syntax.
Strings can be referenced and assigned just like arrays can.

**Structures
Structures are a bunch of different types mooshed together.
This declares a new structure of type "foo" with three members: an integer x, a
float y, and a reference to another foo structure "z".
struct foo:
   x int
   y float
   z foo
end

Structures can be polymorphic:

struct list(%t):
   item %t
   next list(%t)
end

**Pointers
Pointers are for low-level programming.  You can point them at arbitrary
addresses.  You can do arithmatic and let them dangle and overrun arrays and
fandango on core and all sorts of things.  Try to never use them.

type foo_p: pointer(foo)

var someFoo foo: ...
var p1 foo_p: (ref someFoo)
var foo2 foo: (deref p1)
p1 <- (+ p1 -79)
foo2 <- (deref p1)  ; Kaboom!  You'd better pray this segfaults.


**Tagged Unions
Tagged unions consist of an integer and a reference smooshed against each other.
Yeah, I dunno how to explain these right now.

union foo:
   Foo( int )
   Bar( somestruct )
   Bop( float )
end

var x foo: :Foo( 10 )
typecase x:
   case Foo: (doSomethingWithInt x)
   case Bar: (doSomethingWithSomeStruct x)
   case Bop: (doSomethingWithFloat x)
end
   

**Enumerations
Enumerations are basically named numbers.  However, unlike C, they're actually
type-checked.

enum foo:
   Foo  ; = 0
   Bar <- 30  ; = 30
   Bop  ; = 31
   Baz <- -3  ; = -3
   Quux <- 30  ; Compilation error; duplicates are invalid.
end

We may automagically get a couple functions now...  foo2int and int2foo.
This lets enumerations have meaningful numerical values, like months and
stuff.  For int2foo, they'll naturally check that the integer is actually in a valid
range.



*Program Structure

Everything is evaluated from left to right. All expressions are evaluated in
the order they are written. Program execution probably starts at the function
called "main" which recieves as its argument an array of strings as its argument, 
and returns an integer as the program's return value, yadda yadda.

A program is a bunch of statements, for now. We may add more declerations like namespaces and such soon.

*Statements

There are only a few kinds of statements, all of which happen outside of
functions: global variable defintions (for globals, constants, functions,
etc), and type definitions (structures, etc).
We will add module definitions somewhere.

The most basic thing is global variable definitions, which are also used for function definitions with a bit of syntactic sugar

def somename type: someexpression

def somefunc function-of-whatever-type-signature: fun args {rettype} ... end

defun funcname args {rettype} end

**Type Definition
type foo: bar
struct foo: ... end
union foo: ... end
enum foo: ... end


**Builtin types:
int
float
char
string
array(%a)
pointer(%a)
fun(argtype, argtype, ...)(rettype, rettype, ...)

There will (someday) be more builtin types of various sizes; long, double, byte, word,
possibly a few more.  There will be types that explicitly state their size and
signedness, such as 'int8', 'uint8', 'int16', 'uint16', etc.  There will also
be constants that tell you just how big 'int', 'float' and so on are on the
given platform.

We'll have basically the entire Scheme numerical tower, it'll just be a
library.


*Expressions

We start with only a few types of expressions apart from literals and
variables: function definitions, if statements, while statements, function
calls, and variable bindings, and typecases.

XXX: To do: Assignment!  Doh.
XXX: Hmm.  Array references CAN be functions, but that's sorta nasty.
Structure references are even worse.
XXX: Explicit scope blocks?


**Function Definitions

Functions can return multiple values, and have to have the potential to take arbitrary numbers of arguments.
Right now, these are anonymous functions.  Non-anonymous functions are
basically just global variables.

XXX: To do: make better syntax (the {} for return types, especially... maybe
||?)
XXX: So far, functions must ALWAYS return at least one value.  This may end up
changing.  Zero is just another possible number of return values, yes?

fun x int, y float, z somethingelse {returntype} ... end

Optional arguments would be very nice, and keywords MIGHT be a good idea as well. Maybe optional arguments and keywords go together...

**Function Calls

(f x1 x2 ...)

All math and logic and such is function calls for now.
It'd be nice to inline them someday.

**If and While

if a then b (elif c)* (else z) end

while a do b end

**Variable Binding

var x int: a
var y float: b
var z somethingelse: c
var a int, b float, c string: (someComplicatedFunction)

XXX: Explicit scope a la Lisp is cool!
Possibly not what we want to do in the end, but cool nonetheless.

**Typecase
typecase x:
   case Foo: (doSomethingWithInt x)
   case Bar: (doSomethingWithSomeStruct x)
   case Bop: (doSomethingWithFloat x)
end

**Return
return <expr>
return <expr> <expr> <expr>

**Assignment
a <- b
a b c <- d e f

*Modules

Right now, we have no module system.

The choices here abound.  Modules can be flat or heirarchical, covert or overt (hides or exposes things by default), simple or complex...

I somewhat like the C# system of namespaces, actually.  Heirarchical namespaces that are not explicitly connected to any single file or such, but magically mesh together during loading.


*Exceptions
Oy.


*Library
We need ratios and bignums.  Basically, the whole Scheme numerical tower.
Check out Cocoa.


*Low Level Junk

**Function Call Stuff 
The function caller pushes stuff on the stack, and is responsible for popping
it afterwards. The function called leaves the results on top of the stack
though, so the caller should probably move them somewhere safe before popping
everything.

**Name Mangling

*Notes
Unicode?
XXX: Look for papers on function overloading, aka ad-hoc polymorphism.  I seem
to recall one called "making ad-hoc polymorphism less ad-hoc".  Aha, yes, it
basically talks about Haskell typeclasses.
XXX: Object system!  Look at Objective C.  
XXX: Variable-length arguments for functions!  Eep!
XXX: Exceptions!
XXX: Separate methods from namespaces.
